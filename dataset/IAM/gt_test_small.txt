c04-139-00.jpg	They will be asked to comment on the design of everyday articles

c04-144-00.jpg	Say Granada TV , the producers : " We decided to make
c04-144-01.jpg	the switch because of the topicality of African
c04-144-02.jpg	affairs . The Wesker interview will be seen at a later
c04-144-03.jpg	date . " ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding
c04-144-04.jpg	success last night in ITV's " Private Potter , " his
c04-144-05.jpg	first big TV part . The play was a brilliantly-written
c04-144-06.jpg	essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting
c04-144-07.jpg	man could only be regarded as a machine .
c04-150-00.jpg	Potter screamed during an action , and was arrested . He
c04-150-01.jpg	claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his
c04-150-02.jpg	CO believed him . Courtenay played the part with a gawky ,
c04-150-03.jpg	Northern defiance . The cameras played continuously on his
c04-150-04.jpg	craggy face , and obstinate , baffled eyes . They stripped
c04-150-05.jpg	him of his ugly battle-dress , to leave him for
c04-150-06.jpg	what he was - Potter , a frightened boy who had a
c04-150-07.jpg	vision .
c04-165-00.jpg	The film replaced " What's My Line ? " and " Be My
c04-165-01.jpg	Guest " programmes because of an electricians'
c04-165-02.jpg	strike . It showed Britain today through the eyes
c04-165-03.jpg	of an American TV reporter , Eric Sevareid , and
c04-165-04.jpg	British personalities . Among them - Professor
c04-165-05.jpg	Dennis Brogan , Shelagh Delaney , and Alan Sillitoe .
c04-165-06.jpg	The film covered a wide aspect of the British
c04-165-07.jpg	scene , ranging from pubs , the Eton wall game ,
c04-165-08.jpg	to the European Common Market .
c04-170-00.jpg	Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
c04-170-01.jpg	education . It was left to reporter Sevareid
c04-170-02.jpg	to make the strongest criticisms . He said
c04-170-03.jpg	that in the race of the modern nations ,
c04-170-04.jpg	Britain was slipping behind ... .
c06-011-00.jpg	ALSO present is a London journalist who
c06-011-01.jpg	arrived two hours earlier by appointment
c06-011-02.jpg	to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
c06-011-03.jpg	The Hostage about his new work , if any ,
c06-011-04.jpg	and who is now being pluckily convivial
c06-011-05.jpg	to fight off the frustration . The telephone
c06-011-06.jpg	has rung a couple of times , calls from
c06-011-07.jpg	other chums sniffing the wind and
c06-011-08.jpg	offering to drop by for a chat .
d01-016-00.jpg	The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
d01-016-01.jpg	the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01-016-02.jpg	plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote .
d01-016-03.jpg	The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
d01-019-00.jpg	There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01-019-01.jpg	Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
d01-019-02.jpg	present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
d01-019-03.jpg	original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was
d01-019-04.jpg	accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he
d01-019-05.jpg	could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order .
d01-049-00.jpg	The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01-049-01.jpg	case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,
d01-049-02.jpg	he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly
d01-049-03.jpg	how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-04.jpg	been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-05.jpg	showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-06.jpg	simple and coherent plan . To understand how
d01-049-07.jpg	this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-08.jpg	text of the Gospel .
d01-052-00.jpg	THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-01.jpg	written in Greek . A modern text of the
d01-052-02.jpg	Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-03.jpg	scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-04.jpg	scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-05.jpg	which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-06.jpg	wording . It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-07.jpg	text with absolute precision .
d01-080-00.jpg	The bar was the commonest marking , but others
d01-080-01.jpg	were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-02.jpg	bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as
d01-080-03.jpg	it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
d01-080-04.jpg	paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-05.jpg	the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-06.jpg	some markings would be used , although which , it is
d01-080-07.jpg	impossible to say .
d01-085-00.jpg	Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01-085-01.jpg	the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
d01-085-02.jpg	original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,
d01-085-03.jpg	whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in
d01-085-04.jpg	columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-05.jpg	manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
d01-085-06.jpg	about one third of a page of Souter's print .
d01-098-00.jpg	The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-01.jpg	and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
d01-098-02.jpg	a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01-098-03.jpg	which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04.jpg	this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01-098-05.jpg	was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
d01-098-06.jpg	an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-098-07.jpg	reference .
d01-104-00.jpg	This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01.jpg	ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-02.jpg	the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03.jpg	As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04.jpg	overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-05.jpg	information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06.jpg	The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07.jpg	sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01-104-08.jpg	they are in modern books .
d01-118-00.jpg	Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-01.jpg	might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-02.jpg	whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-03.jpg	a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-04.jpg	writing , but any papyrus left unused at the
d01-118-05.jpg	end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
d01-118-06.jpg	the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on .
d01-123-00.jpg	The verso of the roll was blank , and one
d01-123-01.jpg	cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,
d01-123-02.jpg	sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,
d01-123-03.jpg	while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01-123-04.jpg	The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
d01-123-05.jpg	in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra
d01-123-06.jpg	sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-07.jpg	over the binding , or the whole codex rebound .
d03-117-00.jpg	A natural transition from gardens and
d03-117-01.jpg	orchards to the vital question of water
d03-117-02.jpg	supply . The pools are probably natural springs
d03-117-03.jpg	enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
d03-117-04.jpg	the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
d03-117-05.jpg	construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,
d03-117-06.jpg	which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
d03-117-07.jpg	in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
d03-117-08.jpg	reservoirs for water inside the town .
d04-012-00.jpg	The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01.jpg	personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
d04-012-02.jpg	word " SHAMIR " means guarded or preser-
d04-012-03.jpg	ved . Therefore , the real man , who
d04-012-04.jpg	regards himself as insignificant , as the
d04-012-05.jpg	prayer says : " What am I ? A worm " , he
d04-012-06.jpg	is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07.jpg	the Shmah , loves the Lord God with
d04-012-08.jpg	all his heart , and with all his soul and
d04-012-09.jpg	with all his might and studies the
d04-012-10.jpg	word of God .
d04-016-00.jpg	This man is the worm , the creature that
d04-016-01.jpg	cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
d04-016-02.jpg	a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-03.jpg	self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
d04-016-04.jpg	Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-05.jpg	to mould our character , to melt our
d04-016-06.jpg	heart of stone . This Shamir helps
d04-016-07.jpg	us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-08.jpg	for God to come nearer to God .
d04-021-00.jpg	The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-01.jpg	books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-02.jpg	diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest
d04-021-03.jpg	facts . And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-04.jpg	beginning . It is " the stone , which the builders
d04-021-05.jpg	refused , but it is to become the head-stone
d04-021-06.jpg	of the corner " . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall
d04-021-07.jpg	tell !
d04-028-00.jpg	" For the stone shall cry out of the wall " , like
d04-028-01.jpg	Baalam's ass , " and the purlin of timber shall
d04-028-02.jpg	creak in answer " " if the roof of our security is
d04-028-03.jpg	crushing our soul " ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is
d04-028-04.jpg	through the Shamir : " That the earth shall be
d04-028-05.jpg	filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
d04-028-06.jpg	Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " ( Hab. 2 , 14 . )
d04-032-00.jpg	The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,
d04-032-01.jpg	which is written on two plates , the hard facts
d04-032-02.jpg	of life , and all facts are " one " . We have all
d04-032-03.jpg	come across human Shamirs and they leave
d04-032-04.jpg	a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
d04-032-05.jpg	They make us the Altar for God to emit
d04-032-06.jpg	the Light which can be read in every
d04-032-07.jpg	language . The Shamir is the " seventh " and
d04-032-08.jpg	most important creature , that was created on
d04-032-09.jpg	the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the
d04-032-10.jpg	Sabbath , real peace to the whole world .
d04-037-00.jpg	Then the whole earth will be His Altar . " And it
d04-037-01.jpg	shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken
d04-037-02.jpg	diligently unto my commandments , which I command
d04-037-03.jpg	you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to
d04-037-04.jpg	serve Him with all your heart and with all
d04-037-05.jpg	your soul . " This may seem very good , but there
d04-037-06.jpg	is something deficient .
d04-047-00.jpg	Under such conditions without putting your
d04-047-01.jpg	mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-02.jpg	summons of destiny , to solve the economic
d04-047-03.jpg	problems . Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
d04-047-04.jpg	Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) " if Israel does not fulfil
d04-047-05.jpg	the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the
d04-047-06.jpg	Lord God with all their visionary power ,
d04-047-07.jpg	the work will have to be done by each
d04-047-08.jpg	individual " .
d04-050-00.jpg	They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power
d04-050-01.jpg	and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart
d04-050-02.jpg	selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-03.jpg	gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in
d04-050-04.jpg	for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your
d04-050-05.jpg	corn , your wine and your oil .
d04-053-00.jpg	Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
d04-053-01.jpg	freedom from fear , fear of starvation in the
d04-053-02.jpg	midst of plenty . Help will not be easily forth-
d04-053-03.jpg	coming for the people in need . They will
d04-053-04.jpg	think of the animals first ( which is of course
d04-053-05.jpg	our duty ) . Of course the individual will
d04-053-06.jpg	eat and be full but : " Take heed to yourself ,
d04-053-07.jpg	that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn
d04-053-08.jpg	aside , and serve other gods , and worship them " ,
